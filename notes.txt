User creation for User.js model created duplicate users 11-12-2024.  This is expected, per the lesson 41 and 42.

1/25/25: have error for "OAuth Strategy requires a verify callback.  Online shows this may be an issue with parentheses placement, but it looks right.  Other problem?
        When you fix this, commit to git and start a new branch for new features
        - Verify callback is required to be able to verify the access tokens added by the user to call the API.

1/27/25: enabled cookies inside application, then told passport to use cookies to manage authentication.

1/28/25: tested Authentication flow successfully: tauth routes in routes.  localhost:5000/auth/google/callback doesn't load, but it creates a cookie for the current user
        This is expected - haven't properly handled request yet.  Just testing route to create cookie.  This works, so you can continue.
        when you load http://localhost:5000/api/current_user, you see details of the user model exactly as it exists inside of application.  
        Still recieve an OAuth error in terminal for "parseErrorResponse"
